This is John's personal developer notes for the CDA1 project.  Probably pretty boring reading

8/21/23

* Project setup & Github repo creation.
* Completed first version of rqmts spec.

TODO:
- Run existing code to ensure separated classes have proper import stmts, and missing curriculum function is no longer needed.
