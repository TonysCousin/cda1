This is John's personal developer notes for the CDA1 project.  Probably pretty boring reading
for anyone not intently helping out.

8/21/23

* Project setup & Github repo creation.
* Completed first version of rqmts spec.

8/22/23

* Got legacy cda0 code running after breaking up all the classes in the main environment file
  so they are now in their own files.

8/23/23

* Rewrote the Roadway class to represent the new road geometry.

8/24/23

* Fixed some things in inference prgm and got it to display the new roadway.

8/27/23

* Began revamping the environment model to be more generalized with roadway definition and vehicle population.

8/28/23

* Continued building new environment model.


TODO:
- Define the Vehicle interface and set up configs to specify the vehicles in a given scenario.
- Review all TODOs
- Overhaul the env to execute any number of vehicles, each with possibly a different dynamics model and control model.
- Adapt the cda0 neighbor basic vehicle dynamics model for the first derived type.
- Allow env ctor to be called with an initialization code. 
	- value lane_exercise -> cycles reset() through 6 episodes, and each episode places a single vehicle at the
	  beginning of each lane, in sequence, and lets it run the entire lane. Use this to verify the basic functions
	  of the env, roadway, and graphics all work correctly.
- Check all uses of Constants.SCENARIO_LENGTH
